  Hi, my name's Patrik and I'm currently working as a Senior Sofware Developer in the energy industry. In my short, but eventful career in software development I had the chance to work in multiple domains - from betting, through telecommunications, banking and so on all the way to energetics. All of them had something in common - delivering functionality in high quality and on time.

  The key principles for me are mutual respect, team work, clean coding (KISS, DRY, etc.) and testability - I am the one who gets things done. 

  ... and I am looking for new interesting projects, so don`t hesitate to hit me up :)
